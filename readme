This handy script enhances my apartment buzzer. In my building, the apartment
buzzer calls a phone. After answering the phone, you can speak with the person
at the door and press a certain number to unlock the front door.

The problem was that my boyfriend and I didn't want to pay for a landline, and
using only one of our cell phones was really inconvenient when the other person
wasn't home!

This script uses a service called Tropo (www.tropo.com). The script is hosted by
Tropo, which provides a local phone number. When that number is called, the
script is run.

Our apartment buzzer is set to call that Tropo number. When it does, the script
tells both of our cell phones to ring, and whoever picks up first "wins." Once
one phone has been picked up, the other stops ringing.
